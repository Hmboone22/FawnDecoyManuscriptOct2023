# FawnDecoyManuscriptOct2023
Boone et al. Fawn Decoy Manuscript Dataset

Data found within this document was conducted in the Eastern half of North Carolina from May to July 2018
Data is the all "mortality" events [predators within 2.5m or physically touched the fawn decoy]
Non-mortality events were not included in this dataset

This dataset follows an intial 2-week camera survey which was used to calculate each camera site's Predator Detection Rate
firstpred tab only takes the first predator mortality per camera-decoy period and was used in the final analysis. Multiple sites had multiple predators cause decoy mortalities but at times the decoy was either badly damaged or dragged away from the site. Thus, we limited our final analysis to just focus on the first encounter. 

Data asscoaited with the following Manuscript and authors:

Using decoys and camera traps to estimate depredation rates and neonate survival
Authors: Hailey Boone, Krishna Pacifici, Christopher E. Moorman, and Roland Kays
Journal: PlosONE
